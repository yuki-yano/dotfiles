# rtk-hook-version: 3
# RTK Claude Code hook - rewrites commands to use rtk for token savings.
# Requires: rtk >= 0.23.0, jq
#
# This is a thin delegating hook: all rewrite logic lives in `rtk rewrite`,
# which is the single source of truth (src/discover/registry.rs).
# To add or change rewrite rules, edit the Rust registry, not this file.
#
# Exit code protocol for `rtk rewrite`:
#   0 + stdout  Rewrite found, no deny/ask rule matched -> auto-allow
#   1           No RTK equivalent -> pass through unchanged
#   2           Deny rule matched -> pass through (Claude Code native deny handles it)
#   3 + stdout  Ask rule matched -> rewrite but let Claude Code prompt the user
